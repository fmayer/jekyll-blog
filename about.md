This is the blog of Florian Mayer. I am soon starting as a Site Reliability Engineer at Google UK. All views expressed here are mine alone and neither those of Google nor of the Queen of England. 

Before I joined Google, I studied Software & Information Engineering at Vienna University of Technology, followed by a semester of Computational Intelligence. I am very interested in formal logic and theoretical computer science.
